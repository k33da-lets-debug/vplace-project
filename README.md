# What is this project all about.

VPlace app designed for Vidyalankar School of Information Technology placement cell, which aims to reduce the amount of manual work needed for maintaining the records of each and every student in Vidyalankar School of Information Technology. This app is a cross platform app built around Ionic framework. This app allows students to keep a record of all the upcoming events related to placement and to keep a track record of their performance as well.
The app also allows students to maintain a digital resume and can be updated as and when its needed. The app also displays the personal as well as the academic data of a particular student to the admin.
